# INTERNSHIP-TASKS
1. Installed python 3.7 on the machine
2. Used:
```
pip install virtualenv

```
to install virtual environment

3. Generated a directory named tutorial-env on my desktop using terminal where i want to run the virtual environment.
```
python3 -m venv tutorial-env

```
This generates a tutorial-env folder on mac if it's not there, it also adds supporting docs including the copy of python interpretor.


4. Once virtual environment is created it can be activated using the following command:
```
source tutorial-env/bin/activate

```
5. Once the environment is activated we can then use it to open jupyter notebook but first we need to install jupyter notebook using:
```
pip install jupyter notebook

```
6. Once it is downloaded we can then open jupyter notebook by
```
jupyter notebook
```
7. Then we download the dataset from kaggle using the provided link on trello 
8. Once we download it we can then use jupyter notebook to open the dataset(Using pandas) and perform our analysis. We will start with importing the library:
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
```
9. In order to generate graphs we first need to import the libraries which we will use:
```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set()
```
10. Once dataset is loaded we will then use the following commands to see the head, to know the data types of column and shape
```
df.head()
df.shape
df.dtypes
```
11. Once we inspect the variables we will then generate the plot using:
```
sns.countplot(data = df, x = 'Y')
plt.xlabel("Count")
plt.ylabel("Quality Rating Column")
plt.title("Bar plot showing Quality rating column's distribution");
```
12. we will then see the graph for Y which is our Quality rating column, Observations made:
The plot shows that the distribution each category of the quality rating column has the same number of observations.
